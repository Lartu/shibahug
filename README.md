# üêï ShibaHug üêï
PHP library that makes interfacing PHP with MySQL as easy as pie!

## Why use ShibaHug?

ShibaHug is designed to be super easy to use, super tiny and super straight to the point. You could use bigger and more complicated libraries, with certainly more features, or just use the build in methods and classes PHP offers, but if you want something simple and clean that's definitely plug-and-play with no fuss and no problems, you should give ShibaHug a try.

## How to install
Just include de ShibaHug library in your project and you are done.
```php
include "shibahug.php";
```
ShibaHug requires the `mysqli` module to be available. If you have a default *PHP 5* or above installation you should be alright. If you purposely disabled the module, you should enable it in order to use this library.

## How to Use
After including the library in your project, you'll have to connect to a database. I normaly recommend storing your connection parameters in separate variables and then calling the connection with those variables as parameters whenever you want to perform an operation on your database, but that's up to you.

```php
//Connection parameters
$database_url = "localhost";
$username = "myUser";
$password = "password1234";
$dbname = "myDatabase";

//Connect to the database
sqlConnect($database_url, $username, $password, $dbname);
```

After you've finished doing whatever it was you needed to do with your database, close the connection using:
```php
sqlClose();
```
